# Heart_attack_chances
To find what are the causes that lead to chances of heart attack
The Heart dataset was taken from kaggle(https://www.kaggle.com/rashikrahmanpritom/heart-attack-analysis-prediction-dataset)
and is inspired by the work of deeksha rai(https://www.kaggle.com/deeksharai/heart-attack-prediction-accuracy-90)


About dataset:
age - Age of the patient
sex - Sex of the patient
cp - Chest pain type ~ 0 = Typical Angina, 1 = Atypical Angina, 2 = Non-anginal Pain, 3 = Asymptomatic
trtbps - Resting blood pressure (in mm Hg)
chol - Cholestoral in mg/dl fetched via BMI sensor
fbs - (fasting blood sugar > 120 mg/dl) ~ 1 = True, 0 = False
restecg - Resting electrocardiographic results ~ 0 = Normal, 1 = ST-T wave normality, 2 = Left ventricular hypertrophy
thalachh - Maximum heart rate achieved
oldpeak - Previous peak
slp - Slope
caa - Number of major vessels
thall - Thalium Stress Test result ~ (0,3)
exng - Exercise induced angina ~ 1 = Yes, 0 = No
output - target : 0= less chance of heart attack 1= more chance of heart attack
